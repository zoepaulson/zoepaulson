      <p>...same with paragraphs within sections.</p>

    <p><u>Inline elements</u> change things within the lines, like <strong>bolding</strong> or <em>italicizing</em>.</p>

    <p>An href tag means <a href="img/tree.jpg">hypertext reference</a> and it creates a link.</p>

    <img src="img/tree.jpg" alt="Zoe with a pretty tree">
    <!--the alt tag shows what should be there if the image doesn't load, or if someone is using a screenreader-->

    <p>You can use the img tag to attach a picture!</p>
    <!--For the img tag to work all the time, you need your image to be in the github folder or something that is connected to the internet-->
