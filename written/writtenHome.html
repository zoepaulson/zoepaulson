        <h3>One Note Stand: Singing their Way to Perfection</h3>
        <h4>by Zoe Paulson</h4>
        <p>	Every Thursday and Sunday night this past fall, 13 CU Boulder students gathered to practice their singing craft together. They broke into small groups to practice their parts. In one room, men sang deep sounding “dum-dum-de-dums.” In another, the women sang melodic “ah-ah-ahs.” Scattered into separate elements, the song hardly sounds like a song. Along, the different lines sound nice, but to the untrained ear, it does not sound like anything that you might have heard before.
